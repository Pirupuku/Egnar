# Egnar modified
WoW 1.12.1 addon. Shows a range indicator for all classes.
You need your spells on your actionbar as the addon checks with the API function "IsActionInRange(slot)" the range to the target. The addon just works on hostile and neutral mobs, not on friendly targets for buffs or heals!
Also the range check won't work for macros.

Actual appearance might be different from the screenshot.
